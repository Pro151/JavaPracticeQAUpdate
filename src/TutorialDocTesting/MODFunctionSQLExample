The `MOD` function in SQL is used to return the remainder of a division operation.
It calculates the remainder when one number (the dividend) is divided by another number (the divisor). Here's an example of how to use the `MOD` function:

Suppose you have a table named "numbers" with a column "value" that contains various numbers.
 You want to retrieve the numbers that are divisible by 5, along with their remainders when divided by 5.

Here's how you can achieve this using the `MOD` function:

```sql
SELECT value, MOD(value, 5) AS remainder
FROM numbers
WHERE MOD(value, 5) = 0;
```

In this example:
- The `MOD(value, 5)` calculates the remainder of each value in the "value" column when divided by 5.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only the rows where the remainder is 0,
 indicating that the number is divisible by 5.

For instance, if the "numbers" table contains the values 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, the query would return:

```
| value | remainder |
|-------|-----------|
| 10    | 0         |
| 15    | 0         |
| 20    | 0         |
| 25    | 0         |
| 30    | 0         |
```

This query demonstrates how the `MOD` function can be used to filter and retrieve data based on the remainder
 of a division operation.
