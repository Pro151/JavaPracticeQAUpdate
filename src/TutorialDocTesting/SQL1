Certainly! Here are some SQL interview queries that are commonly asked during interviews for a Software QA Lead position, along with examples:

**1. Retrieve data from a table:**
   Retrieve all the information from the "employees" table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**2. Filter data using WHERE clause:**
   Retrieve the names of employees who have a salary greater than $50,000.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

**3. Joining tables:**
   Retrieve the names of employees along with their department names from two tables, "employees" and "departments".

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**4. Grouping and Aggregation:**
   Calculate the average salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

**5. Subqueries:**
   Retrieve the names of employees who have a salary higher than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**6. Ordering results:**
   Retrieve the names of employees in ascending order of their hire dates.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date ASC;
```

**7. Using IN clause:**
   Retrieve the names of employees who belong to departments with IDs 101, 102, and 103.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (101, 102, 103);
```

**8. Limiting results:**
   Retrieve the top 5 highest-paid employees.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**9. Self-Join:**
   Retrieve the names of employees and their managers' names from the same "employees" table.

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

**10. NULL handling:**
   Retrieve the names of employees who do not have a manager.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
```

These queries cover a range of SQL concepts and scenarios that a Software QA Lead might encounter. During an interview, it's important not only to provide the correct query but also to explain your thought process and any optimizations you might consider for larger databases.
