Certainly! Here are some common SQL interview questions along with query examples to help you prepare:

**1. SELECT Basics:**
   - Question: Retrieve all columns from the "employees" table.
   - Query: `SELECT * FROM employees;`

**2. WHERE Clause:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees whose salary is greater than $50,000.
   - Query: `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;`

**3. JOINs:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees along with their department names.
   - Query: `SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;`

**4. GROUP BY and HAVING:**
   - Question: Retrieve the average salary of employees in each department, only showing departments with an average salary greater than $60,000.
   - Query: `SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING avg_salary > 60000;`

**5. ORDER BY:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees in ascending order of their hire date.
   - Query: `SELECT name FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date ASC;`

**6. Subqueries:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees who work in departments with the lowest budget.
   - Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT name
   FROM employees
   WHERE department_id IN (
       SELECT department_id
       FROM departments
       WHERE budget = (SELECT MIN(budget) FROM departments)
   );
   ```

**7. Self-Joins:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees and their managers' names.
   - Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT e.name AS employee_name, m.name AS manager_name
   FROM employees e
   INNER JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
   ```

**8. Substring and LIKE:**
   - Question: Retrieve the names of employees whose names start with "Joh".
   - Query: `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'Joh%';`

**9. Count and Distinct:**
   - Question: Count the number of employees in each department.
   - Query: `SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;`

**10. Aggregate Functions:**
   - Question: Retrieve the highest and lowest salary in the "employees" table.
   - Query: `SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary FROM employees;`

These examples cover a range of SQL concepts commonly tested in interviews.
Make sure to understand these concepts and practice writing queries to solve similar problems.
Keep in mind that real-world scenarios can be more complex, so adapt your knowledge accordingly.
