Certainly, here are some SQL interview queries that are commonly asked during interviews for the role of Software QA Lead. These queries cover various aspects of SQL, including querying, testing, and data manipulation. I'll provide the queries along with brief explanations and examples:

**1. Retrieve Data:**
Retrieve all the columns from the "employees" table where the department is "QA".

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'QA';
```

**2. Aggregation:**
Calculate the average salary of all employees in the "salary" table.

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salary;
```

**3. Joining Tables:**
Retrieve the names of employees along with their corresponding project names from the "employees" and "projects" tables.

```sql
SELECT e.name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
JOIN projects p ON e.project_id = p.project_id;
```

**4. Subqueries:**
Retrieve the names of employees who have a salary greater than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**5. Testing Scenarios:**
You have a table named "orders" with columns "order_id", "order_date", and "status". Write a query to find the count of orders placed on a specific date with a "Completed" status.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE order_date = '2023-08-25' AND status = 'Completed';
```

**6. Data Modification:**
Update the salary of an employee with ID 101 to 75000.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 75000
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

**7. Delete Records:**
Delete all orders from the "orders" table where the status is "Cancelled".

```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Cancelled';
```

**8. NULL Handling:**
Retrieve the names of employees who do not have an assigned project.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE project_id IS NULL;
```

**9. Data Validation:**
Find duplicate entries in the "customers" table based on the "email" column.

```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**10. Performance Optimization:**
Write a query to retrieve the top 5 products with the highest sales from the "sales" table, ordered by sales amount in descending order.

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

These queries cover a range of SQL concepts and skills that Software QA Leads might need during their work. Remember to understand the fundamentals, practice writing queries, and be prepared to explain your thought process during an interview.
