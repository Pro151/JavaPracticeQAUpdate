Certainly! Here are some Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) interview questions and problems that are commonly asked for QA Lead or Senior QA roles in tech product-based companies. Each question comes with a Java code example and an explanation:

1. **Question: Explain the SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design.**
   - Answer: The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to create maintainable and flexible software:
     - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
     - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
     - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting program correctness.
     - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
     - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

2. **Problem: Implement a Logger Interface Following SOLID Principles:**
   - Description: Create a logger interface that adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle, and implement different logger classes.
   - Code Example (Java):
   ```java
   interface Logger {
       void log(String message);
   }

   class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
       public void log(String message) {
           System.out.println("Console: " + message);
       }
   }

   class FileLogger implements Logger {
       public void log(String message) {
           // Implement file logging
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Question: Explain the Difference Between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy.**
   - Answer: Shallow copy copies the references of objects but not the objects themselves. Deep copy creates new objects and copies the values of the original objects.

4. **Problem: Implement a Deep Copy of a Complex Object:**
   - Description: Create a deep copy method for a complex object that contains nested objects.
   - Code Example (Java):
   ```java
   class Address {
       String city;
       String state;
   }

   class Employee implements Cloneable {
       String name;
       Address address;

       public Employee(String name, Address address) {
           this.name = name;
           this.address = address;
       }

       @Override
       protected Employee clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
           Employee cloned = (Employee) super.clone();
           cloned.address = new Address();
           cloned.address.city = this.address.city;
           cloned.address.state = this.address.state;
           return cloned;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Question: Explain the Concept of Mocking in Unit Testing.**
   - Answer: Mocking involves creating simulated objects (mocks) to replace real objects in unit tests. Mocks help isolate the unit under test and control the behavior of dependencies.

6. **Problem: Write a Unit Test with Mocking Using a Testing Framework (e.g., Mockito):**
   - Description: Write a unit test for a class that uses an external service dependency. Mock the external service using a testing framework.
   - Code Example (Java with Mockito):
   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

   class ExternalService {
       String getData() {
           return "External Data";
       }
   }

   class DataService {
       private ExternalService externalService;

       public DataService(ExternalService externalService) {
           this.externalService = externalService;
       }

       String fetchData() {
           return externalService.getData();
       }
   }

   class DataServiceTest {
       @Test
       void testFetchDataWithMocking() {
           ExternalService mockService = mock(ExternalService.class);
           when(mockService.getData()).thenReturn("Mocked Data");

           DataService dataService = new DataService(mockService);
           String result = dataService.fetchData();

           // Assert result
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Question: Explain the Importance of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in Testing.**
   - Answer: CI/CD automates the process of testing, building, and deploying software, ensuring frequent and reliable releases. It helps identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

8. **Problem: Describe a Scenario Where Automated Tests Can Fail Unexpectedly Due to Environmental Factors:**
   - Description: Explain how automated tests might fail due to factors like network conditions, database state, or external services.

9. **Question: Describe a Situation Where You Needed to Handle a Flaky Test in a Test Suite.**
   - Answer: A flaky test is a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails for the same codebase. Handling flaky tests involves investigating and addressing the root cause to improve test stability.

10. **Problem: Write a Test Plan for Testing a Mobile Application:**
    - Description: Create a comprehensive test plan that covers functional, usability, performance, and security testing for a mobile application.
